              <p class="expandMoreContent" id="showMore1">
                This project was presented by Innovation Skåne, an organization that deals with societal challenges with innovative solutions. The aim of this project was to develop a design
              proposition to support the communication between relatives of patients enrolled in the municipal health care program (Region Skåne), as well as the Perstorp municipality
              itself.
              <br><br>
              The municipal health care program offers
              support for patients that are over the age of 75,
              typically suffering from cognitive diseases such as dementia.<br>This project focuses
              on Perstorp, a municipality with 7,000 residents
              in the northern region of Skåne, Sweden and is undertaken in collaboration between
              Malmö University and Innovation Skåne.<br>
              Caretaking relatives are defined in the framework
              of this project as stakeholders that care for a close family member more than once per week and
              typically live with that person in the same household. In our age group, the caretaking relative
              is hence often times the partner. Field research
              revealed that in this focus group, cognitive diseases such as dementia and depression are most
              common, and therefore will be focused on in this
              project.
              In order to identify new service design opportunities for our focus group, insights into the
              ecosystem that surround the caretaking relative
              including the municipality, the home care service
              and the relative support center, are gathered
              through interviews and a co-design workshop,
              as well as desk research. The summary of
              the insights is used to propose a redesigned digital
              service design solution.</p>

              <h3>Background Research</h3>
              <p class="expandMoreContent" id="showMore2">The background research provided a valuable starting
                point to gather insights into personal care situations of relatives in the small municipality of
                Perstorp. It appears also from research that when
                caretaking of a family member works successfully and the relative is supported in the best way
                possible, it enhances and increases quality of life
                for both the patient and the relative.<br>
                Currently, 1,3 million people help and support
                a close family member regularly in Sweden
                and thereby fall under the category of “relative
                caretaker”. The majority are part of the working
                population and their work as caretakers saves
                the Swedish society 177 billion Swedish kronor
                every year (NKA, 2016).
                Sweden introduced the individualized care
                system in 2009, which is currently in place and
                assigned the municipalities the obligation and
                autonomy to support relatives in caretaking
                of family members (Riksrevisionen, 2017). The
                criteria for such support are individualisation,
                flexibility and quality. The government authorized
                Socialstyrelsen, the social ministry, to guide the
                municipalities in the implementation and founded a national competence center for capacity
                building (NKA, 2016).
                However, the Swedish National Audit Office that
                is tasked to analyze the impact of national policies, proclaims that the state is not able to address the individual needs of relative caretakers
                in a flexible way. There are large differences within as well as between municipalities in terms of
                support offered and municipalities have organized and financed their relative support differently
                and municipalities have not received enough
                guidance on how to support relatives (Riksrevisionen, 2017) and reporting and documentation
                of municipalities has been weak. The needs of
                relatives have not been fully met, which include
                both the trust that the partner or family member
                receives good care and treatment but also to receive individual and flexible support. Care-taking
                by a relative is voluntary in Sweden, since the
                state offers an alternative through the social care
                services. However, as the Swedish National Audit
                Office’s assessment found through interviews is
                that many take on more responsibility than they
                actually want to due to shortcomings in existing
                health and social care services. Worries about
                the health and social care for the family member is a major factor for the care-taking person‘s
                needs. This includes trust in the housing situation, home care, treatment and having educated
                staff with the right expertise. Many relatives feel
                that one of the heaviest burdens they have to
                bear is the coordinating role they often have to
                take on board for tasks that would otherwise not
                be taken care of. The carer’s need to be recognised and receive information and knowledge is
                rarely met in contacts with health and social care
                services (Riksrevisionen, 2017).
                Socialstyrelsen, the Swedish National Audit Office as well as the National Competence Center
                for Relatives found that the best way to support
                relatives is by providing the close family member
                the best care possible. In addition, relatives need
                to know where and which kind of help they can
                get, how they should apply and which rights they
                have including support mechanisms such as financial benefits, short term care or adaptation of
                the home to the new needs of the family member. Also, relatives wish to have a better collaboration between different caretakers in the system
                so they do not need to coordinate themselves.
                In addition, relatives seek to get support for
                themselves too, in form of knowledge and skills
                around how to take care of the family member but also for oneself. Information about the
                importance of relatives that take care of a family
                member needs to be disseminated through the
                entire health organization.
                This includes information on how to support
                relative caretakers best with information and a
                personalized approach. Similarly, the Swedish
                National Audit Office interviewees felt that they
                have had to fight to get the services that their
                family member requires from the municipalities
                and that they are at a disadvantage in relation to
                the municipalities when it comes to knowledge
                about which service/s their family member is
                entitled to.
                Research at Lunds University showed, that relatives taking care of someone with dementia or
                depression have the highest burden when taking
                care of that person at home. However, research
                also revealed that relatives that do care for their
                family member at home without experiencing
                high stress have in fact a higher life quality and
                health then when they do not provide care at
                home (Wendel, Anna-Mi, 2015)</p>

<!-- //////////////////////////////////////// Existing Digital Solutions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ -->

                <h3>Existing Digital Offers for Relative Support</h3>
                <p class="expandMoreContent2" id="showMore3">The desk research also covered existing digital solutions in this field. The only existing digital solution was "En bra plats", a website solely made for the support of relatives to provide
                  information and an anonymous place to meet
                  others in the same situation. The service needs
                  to be purchased by the municipality and offers
                  somehting called “Dementslotsen” whcih is essentially
                  a GPS for the relative of someone with cognitive
                  disorders.<br>
                  "En bra plats" consists of 16 steps and it works as
                    hub for stage-specific information to inform the
                    relative what will happen at a specific stage in
                    your loved ones mental decline. For instance one
                    step could tell the relative that it may be time to
                    start looking into having shared care, start looking at which homes is best suited, how to/what
                    kind of help you could get from the municipality,
                    what is common for a sick person to be doing at
                    this time or even how to apply for financial aid.
                    It’s purpose is to help guide the relative through
                    the massive amount of pitfalls that they could
                    fall into whilst taking care of someone with a
                    cognitive disorder. The platform also offers a
                    feature where they match a relative with someone else who is in the same position to exchange
                    experiences as well as share best practice. En
                    bra plats is also used by the caretakers, doctors,
                    nurses and the people who work in the elderly homes for instance. En bra plats works as a
                    way for them to get information about specific
                    cases, they could get into contact with a nurse
                    or a doctor from a larger municipality which has
                    had special cases that may not be as common
                    in small ones and see how they handled it. So
                    En bra plats works also as a platform between
                    relatives and professionals.</p>

                <h3>Field Research</h3>
                <p class="expandMoreContent3" id="showMore4">Approach
                  The team looked at the municipality of Perstorp,
                  analysing existing services that are in place for
                  the relatives. We found multiple organisations
                  that offer support for relatives and were provided
                  with an initial contact for a decision maker within
                  the municipality administration. We started to set
                  up meetings the municipality first and later with
                  external stakeholders from outside the municipality.
                  The interviews took place in Perstorp, Lund, Malmö and also on the phone. After every interview,
                  we analyzed the notes to retrieve main insights
                  out of the interviews.<br><br>
                  We started the first Stakeholder Map before and the first User Journey
                  map after the first interview. Over time we updated these maps and added an empathy map and
                  persona.
                  All of the data we collected from interviews
                  and desk research were later compressed into
                  problems, which we presented at the co-design
                  workshop that we held with various participants
                  in the municipality of Perstorp. At the co-design
                  workshop we narrowed these problems down
                  to define focus areas and problem opportunities
                  with the help of both relatives of patients and
                  staff of the municipality.</p>
