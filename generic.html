        <h2 class="headingTwo">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="expandMoreContent" id="showMore1">
          This project was presented by Innovation Skåne, an organization that deals with societal challenges with
          innovative solutions. The aim of this project was to develop a design
          proposition to support the communication between relatives of patients enrolled in the municipal health care
          program (Region Skåne), as well as the Perstorp municipality
          itself.
          <br><br>
          The municipal health care program offers
          support for patients that are over the age of 75,
          typically suffering from cognitive diseases such as dementia.<br>This project focuses
          on Perstorp, a municipality with 7,000 residents
          in the northern region of Skåne, Sweden and is undertaken in collaboration between
          Malmö University and Innovation Skåne.<br>
          Caretaking relatives are defined in the framework
          of this project as stakeholders that care for a close family member more than once per week and
          typically live with that person in the same household. In our age group, the caretaking relative
          is hence often times the partner. Field research
          revealed that in this focus group, cognitive diseases such as dementia and depression are most
          common, and therefore will be focused on in this
          project.
          In order to identify new service design opportunities for our focus group, insights into the
          ecosystem that surround the caretaking relative
          including the municipality, the home care service
          and the relative support center, are gathered
          through interviews and a co-design workshop,
          as well as desk research. The summary of
          the insights is used to propose a redesigned digital
          service design solution.

          <!-- Background Research -->
          <h3>Background Research</h3>
          <p>The background research provided a valuable starting
            point to gather insights into personal care situations of relatives in the small municipality of
            Perstorp. It appears also from research that when
            caretaking of a family member works successfully and the relative is supported in the best way
            possible, it enhances and increases quality of life
            for both the patient and the relative.<br>
            Currently, 1,3 million people help and support
            a close family member regularly in Sweden
            and thereby fall under the category of “relative
            caretaker”. The majority are part of the working
            population and their work as caretakers saves
            the Swedish society 177 billion Swedish kronor
            every year (NKA, 2016).
            Sweden introduced the individualized care
            system in 2009, which is currently in place and
            assigned the municipalities the obligation and
            autonomy to support relatives in caretaking
            of family members (Riksrevisionen, 2017). The
            criteria for such support are individualisation,
            flexibility and quality. The government authorized
            Socialstyrelsen, the social ministry, to guide the
            municipalities in the implementation and founded a national competence center for capacity
            building (NKA, 2016).
            However, the Swedish National Audit Office that
            is tasked to analyze the impact of national policies, proclaims that the state is not able to address the
            individual needs of relative caretakers
            in a flexible way. There are large differences within as well as between municipalities in terms of
            support offered and municipalities have organized and financed their relative support differently
            and municipalities have not received enough
            guidance on how to support relatives (Riksrevisionen, 2017) and reporting and documentation
            of municipalities has been weak. The needs of
            relatives have not been fully met, which include
            both the trust that the partner or family member
            receives good care and treatment but also to receive individual and flexible support. Care-taking
            by a relative is voluntary in Sweden, since the
            state offers an alternative through the social care
            services. However, as the Swedish National Audit
            Office’s assessment found through interviews is
            that many take on more responsibility than they
            actually want to due to shortcomings in existing
            health and social care services. Worries about
            the health and social care for the family member is a major factor for the care-taking person‘s
            needs. This includes trust in the housing situation, home care, treatment and having educated
            staff with the right expertise. Many relatives feel
            that one of the heaviest burdens they have to
            bear is the coordinating role they often have to
            take on board for tasks that would otherwise not
            be taken care of. The carer’s need to be recognised and receive information and knowledge is
            rarely met in contacts with health and social care
            services (Riksrevisionen, 2017).
            Socialstyrelsen, the Swedish National Audit Office as well as the National Competence Center
            for Relatives found that the best way to support
            relatives is by providing the close family member
            the best care possible. In addition, relatives need
            to know where and which kind of help they can
            get, how they should apply and which rights they
            have including support mechanisms such as financial benefits, short term care or adaptation of
            the home to the new needs of the family member. Also, relatives wish to have a better collaboration between
            different caretakers in the system
            so they do not need to coordinate themselves.
            In addition, relatives seek to get support for
            themselves too, in form of knowledge and skills
            around how to take care of the family member but also for oneself. Information about the
            importance of relatives that take care of a family
            member needs to be disseminated through the
            entire health organization.
            This includes information on how to support
            relative caretakers best with information and a
            personalized approach. Similarly, the Swedish
            National Audit Office interviewees felt that they
            have had to fight to get the services that their
            family member requires from the municipalities
            and that they are at a disadvantage in relation to
            the municipalities when it comes to knowledge
            about which service/s their family member is
            entitled to.
            Research at Lunds University showed, that relatives taking care of someone with dementia or
            depression have the highest burden when taking
            care of that person at home. However, research
            also revealed that relatives that do care for their
            family member at home without experiencing
            high stress have in fact a higher life quality and
            health then when they do not provide care at
            home (Wendel, Anna-Mi, 2015)</p>

          <!-- Existing Digital Solutions -->
          <h3>Existing Digital Offers for Relative Support</h3>
          <p>The desk research also covered existing digital solutions in this
            field. The only existing digital solution was "En bra plats", a website solely made for the support of
            relatives to provide
            information and an anonymous place to meet
            others in the same situation. The service needs
            to be purchased by the municipality and offers
            somehting called “Dementslotsen” whcih is essentially
            a GPS for the relative of someone with cognitive
            disorders.<br>
            "En bra plats" consists of 16 steps and it works as
            hub for stage-specific information to inform the
            relative what will happen at a specific stage in
            your loved ones mental decline. For instance one
            step could tell the relative that it may be time to
            start looking into having shared care, start looking at which homes is best suited, how to/what
            kind of help you could get from the municipality,
            what is common for a sick person to be doing at
            this time or even how to apply for financial aid.
            It’s purpose is to help guide the relative through
            the massive amount of pitfalls that they could
            fall into whilst taking care of someone with a
            cognitive disorder. The platform also offers a
            feature where they match a relative with someone else who is in the same position to exchange
            experiences as well as share best practice. En
            bra plats is also used by the caretakers, doctors,
            nurses and the people who work in the elderly homes for instance. En bra plats works as a
            way for them to get information about specific
            cases, they could get into contact with a nurse
            or a doctor from a larger municipality which has
            had special cases that may not be as common
            in small ones and see how they handled it. So
            En bra plats works also as a platform between
            relatives and professionals.</p>

          <!-- Field Research -->
          <h3>Field Research</h3>
          <p>Approach
            The team looked at the municipality of Perstorp,
            analysing existing services that are in place for
            the relatives. We found multiple organisations
            that offer support for relatives and were provided
            with an initial contact for a decision maker within
            the municipality administration. We started to set
            up meetings the municipality first and later with
            external stakeholders from outside the municipality.
            The interviews took place in Perstorp, Lund, Malmö and also on the phone. After every interview,
            we analyzed the notes to retrieve main insights
            out of the interviews.<br><br>
            We started the first Stakeholder Map before and the first User Journey
            map after the first interview. Over time we updated these maps and added an empathy map and
            persona.
            All of the data we collected from interviews
            and desk research were later compressed into
            problems, which we presented at the co-design
            workshop that we held with various participants
            in the municipality of Perstorp. At the co-design
            workshop we narrowed these problems down
            to define focus areas and problem opportunities
            with the help of both relatives of patients and
            staff of the municipality.</p>

          <!-- Characteristics of Existing Service -->
          <h3>Characteristics of the Existing Service</h3>
          <p>Perstorp exclusively offers support through the
            relative support office which employs one representative who solely cares for and supports
            the relatives of people who currently are within
            the healthcare system. Anyone over 18 years
            that takes care of a close relative is receiving
            this support which offers information, psychological support and a place to meet other relatives. Also, the
            representative informs relatives
            in economic matters, how to apply for support,
            where to turn to when it’s about time for them
            to live in an elderly home. The service is offered
            for a year after the loved one has passed away.
            Currently, the service is offered exclusively via
            phone, a website and mostly personal contact.</p>

          <!-- Initial Stakeholders -->
          <h3>Initial Stakeholders</h3>
          <p>By defining the key stakeholders, we knew
            where the focus needed to be, and most interviews conducted were mainly concerning the
            inner circle, visualised in Fig 1, where stakeholders such as the relative support centre,
            caretakers, red cross and the patient reside.
            Outside the circle we spot stakeholders that are
            less involved in the day to day life of the relative, such as hospitals and pharmacies.
            The most valuable service that we could identify, that currently is offered by the municipality,
            is the relative support person (RSP). An important insight collected from the both interviews
            and desk research is that the relatives needs
            psychological support, where this service exists
            to serve just that. Relatives can contact the
            relative support centre, which is run by only
            one person, Lena, where they can talk about
            the tough situations they face on a daily basis.
            This was identified as one of the best and most
            helpful services the municipality has to offer,
            where one relative quoted “I would not have
            made it without Lena”, expressing great gratitude to this particular service. While Lena strives
            to help as many relatives in the best way possible, she is also overworked, where as many as
            100 relatives contacts her each month, some of
            which meet in person every two weeks.</p>

          <!-- Initial & Revized Stakeholder Maps -->
          <h3>Initial Stakeholder Map</h3>
          <p>Our final stakeholder map includes three main
            actors: the relative, the patient and the municipality as well as related stakeholders like the home
            care service, the elderly home, the relative support office and others. The closer to the centre,
            the more vital they are to the relative (see Fig. 1)</p>

          <h3>User Journey Map</h3>
          <p>The journey map shows the steps of the existing
            service before,during and after. The important
            aspects to note here are the stress level the relative experiences and the emotions that are felt
            during different stages of the service. This can
            then be directly associated with the activities that
            are involved in relation to the touchpoints which
            reflects on some of the major problems.</p>

          <h3>Empathy Map</h3>
          <p>The empathy map is a representation
            of the thoughts and feelings related to
            to what the relative does and says. This
            is providing a slightly deeper insight
            into the experience of the relative and
            the things represented in the map
            stem from the relatives directly. This
            data can be linked to the created persona in Figure 3.</p>

          <p>The actor’s map shows the connections between the
            stakeholders highlighting the important roles in the
            service. It is an overview that focuses on the three
            main stakeholders, represented by the red circles.
            Arguably the activity that goes on between the red
            circles is most important and we can see how other
            aspects of the service come into the scenario, represented by the orange and light red circles.</p>
