          This project was presented by Innovation Skåne, an organization that deals with societal challenges with
          innovative solutions. The aim of this project was to develop a design
          proposition to support the communication between relatives of patients enrolled in the municipal health care
          program (Region Skåne), as well as the Perstorp municipality
          itself.
          <br><br>
          The municipal health care program offers
          support for patients that are over the age of 75,
          typically suffering from cognitive diseases such as dementia.<br>This project focuses
          on Perstorp, a municipality with 7,000 residents
          in the northern region of Skåne, Sweden and is undertaken in collaboration between
          Malmö University and Innovation Skåne.<br>
          Caretaking relatives are defined in the framework
          of this project as stakeholders that care for a close family member more than once per week and
          typically live with that person in the same household. In our age group, the caretaking relative
          is hence often times the partner. Field research
          revealed that in this focus group, cognitive diseases such as dementia and depression are most
          common, and therefore will be focused on in this
          project.
          In order to identify new service design opportunities for our focus group, insights into the
          ecosystem that surround the caretaking relative
          including the municipality, the home care service
          and the relative support center, are gathered
          through interviews and a co-design workshop,
          as well as desk research. The summary of
          the insights is used to propose a redesigned digital
          service design solution.
