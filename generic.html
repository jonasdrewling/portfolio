<!-- Introduction -->

              <p>This project was presented by Innovation Skåne, an organization that deals with societal challenges with innovative solutions. The aim of this project was to develop a design
                proposition to support the communication between relatives of patients enrolled in the municipal health care program (Region Skåne), as well as the Perstorp municipality
                itself.
                <br><br> 
                <span id="dots"></span><span id="more">The municipal health care program offers
                  support for patients that are over the age of 75,
                  typically suffering from cognitive diseases such as dementia, with the focus of the project being
                  on Perstorp, a municipality with 7,000 residents
                  in the northern region of Skåne, Sweden. This
                  project is undertaken in collaboration between
                  Malmö University and Innovation Skåne.
                  Caretaking relatives are defined in the framework
                  of this project as stakeholders that care for a close family member more than once per week and
                  typically live with that person in the same household. In our age group, the caretaking relative
                  is hence often times the partner. Field research
                  revealed that in this focus group, cognitive diseases such as dementia and depression are most
                  common, and therefore will be focused on in this
                  project.
                  In order to identify new service design opportunities for our focus group, insights into the
                  ecosystem that surround the caretaking relative
                  including the municipality, the home care service
                  and the relative support center, are gathered
                  through interviews and a co-design workshop,
                  as well as desk research. The summary of
                  the insights is used to propose a redesigned digital
                  service design solution.</span>
